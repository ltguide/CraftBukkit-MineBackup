# For a full explanation of these settings, visit https://github.com/ltguide/CraftBukkit-MineBackup/wiki/Configuration
# 
# For quick setup, just set copy or compress to true under default_actions. Typical users shouldn't enable both copy and compress.
# You don't need to list every world or setting under that world unless you want to override the defaults.
# The cleanup action does not need to be enabled unless you want it to happen on a set schedule. When disabled, it will automatically trigger after copy/compress.
# The 'ti:me' based settings are in 24-hour format and thus happen once a day.
# You can use 'ti:me', 15m, or 300 for any of the action intervals.
# If you set world-container in bukkit.yml, change directories.worlds as well.
